### 🧠 About Me

I'm a software developer who loves building seamless digital experiences — from pixel-perfect mobile apps to fullstack platforms that scale.  
I nerd out on clean code, clever systems, and emerging tech like **blockchain**, **AI**, and decentralized tools.

In the last year, I’ve:
- Played a major role in building apps used by 100K+ users
- Helped develop a DAO/NFT marketplace for forest-backed assets
- Trained 40+ developers at Rwanda’s most intense bootcamp
